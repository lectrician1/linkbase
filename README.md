# linkbase
 [Linkbase](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Lectrician1/Linkbase) is a proposed database-management tool that allows users to compare and edit similar entries in databases. The initial use will be for comparing discographies among music databases like MusicBrainz and Discogs, and music streaming sites like Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube.
