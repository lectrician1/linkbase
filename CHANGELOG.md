* Rant to Moebeus and make [draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lectrician1/Mini_album_RFC) about how new LOONA mini album "&" has 7 songs and is categorized as a album on YTM and AM but it's an EP/mini album. I want to change mini album to always be mini album on WD and WP.

# 0.1.3.1 - Saturday, June 26, 2021
* Didn't work on stuff. Focused on backing up my local files to raspi using Sycthing but it didn't work.

# 0.1.2 - Friday, June 25, 2021
* Fix Release sizing and grid using StaggaredGridView, yet it is somehow still a bit broken when the window is resized (it clips).
* Add and configure svg images for WD, MB, and D. 
* Center text for property and value in Statement
* Add "done" and "cancel" buttons when in edit mode.
* Add buttons to right of headers. Add grid vs. list view buttons for Releases section as Moebeus proposed.
* Fix window sizing with body and appbar above and below width = 1000.
* Use only vertical sections view for all view widths. I might keep this in the long term.
* Add dark mode 
* Create Discogs API repo since I can't find any library that covers the entire API. Pretty mad about this since the API is huge.

# 0.1.1 - Thursday, June 24, 2021
* Today's release was a lot of backend stuff and probelm solving. Basically only difference is Releases are broken at the moment, there's hover text on the buttons, you can drag Detail statements to Releases, and statement props and values are aligned horizontally and not vertically to support multiple values.

# 0.1.0.1 - wednesday, June 23, 2021
* Deploy to Firebase Hosting for the first time to share progress with Wikidata Ex Musica.
